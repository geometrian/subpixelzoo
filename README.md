# Subpixel Zoo

## Procedural Generator for Subpixel Geometry

Subpixels are numerous, and reference photos are not standardized.

To fix this problem, this program draws them all in the same framework with the same parameters, so that you can make good comparisons.  See parent article [here](https://geometrian.com/programming/reference/subpixelzoo/index.php).
